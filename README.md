## Basics of Networking


Networking Components (Hardware and Software):

Hardware Components:
Network Interface Card (NIC): A NIC is a hardware component that enables a device to connect to a network. It facilitates the transmission and reception of data between the device and the network.
Router: Routers are networking devices that forward data packets between computer networks. They operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and are essential for connecting different networks together.
Switch: Switches are networking devices that forward data packets within a single network. They operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and are used to create LANs by connecting multiple devices together.
Hub: Hubs are networking devices that serve as central connection points for devices in a network. Unlike switches, hubs broadcast data to all devices connected to them, which can lead to network congestion.
Modem: Modems are devices that modulate and demodulate digital data to enable communication over analog transmission mediums such as telephone lines or cable systems. They are used to connect devices to the internet via broadband or dial-up connections.
Software Components:
Network Operating System (NOS): A network operating system is software that provides network services and manages network resources. Examples include Windows Server, Linux, and macOS Server.
Network Management Software: Network management software is used to monitor, configure, and troubleshoot network devices and services. It helps administrators maintain the health and performance of the network.
Network Topologies:

Bus Topology: In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single communication line (the bus). Data travels along the bus, and each device receives the data, but only the intended recipient processes it.
Star Topology: In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data travels from one device to the hub/switch and then is forwarded to the destination device.
Ring Topology: In a ring topology, each device is connected to two other devices, forming a closed loop. Data travels around the ring from one device to the next until it reaches its destination.
Mesh Topology: In a mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device in the network. This redundancy provides multiple paths for data to travel, increasing reliability and fault tolerance.
Hybrid Topology: A hybrid topology combines two or more basic topologies, such as star-bus or star-ring, to meet specific networking requirements.
Network Protocols:

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): TCP/IP is the foundational protocol suite of the internet and most modern networks. It consists of a suite of protocols, including IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, responsible for routing and delivering data packets across networks.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the protocol used for transferring web pages and other hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It defines how clients request resources from servers and how servers respond to those requests.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a network. It provides a reliable and efficient means of uploading and downloading files.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is a protocol used for sending email messages between servers. It defines how email clients communicate with mail servers to send outgoing messages.
DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a protocol used for translating domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It enables users to access websites and other internet resources using human-readable domain names.

## IP Addresses and Subnetting

IPv4 vs. IPv6:

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical addresses expressed in decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1). The rapid growth of the internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion due to its limited address space (approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses).
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 was developed to address the limitations of IPv4 by providing a much larger address space, allowing for an almost infinite number of unique addresses.
IP Address Classes:

IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.
Class A: Reserved for very large networks, with the first bit set to 0 and the next 7 bits representing the network ID (e.g., 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255).
Class B: Intended for medium-sized networks, with the first two bits set to 10 and the next 14 bits representing the network ID (e.g., 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255).
Class C: Used for small networks, with the first three bits set to 110 and the next 21 bits representing the network ID (e.g., 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255).
Class D: Reserved for multicast addresses (e.g., 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255).
Class E: Reserved for experimental use (e.g., 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).
Subnetting Basics:

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve efficiency, security, and manageability.
Subnetting involves borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address to create subnets, with the remaining bits used for host addresses.
Subnet masks are used to determine which portion of an IP address represents the network ID and which portion represents the host ID.
Subnet Masks and CIDR Notation:

A subnet mask is a 32-bit binary number used to divide an IP address into network and host portions. It consists of a series of contiguous 1s followed by a series of contiguous 0s (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a compact representation of an IP address and subnet mask using the slash (/) notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). The number after the slash represents the number of bits in the subnet mask.
